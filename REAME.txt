INSTALL:
sudo apt-get install cmake git gcc python3 pip3 eigen libsdl2-dev
sudo pip3 cget
./build/install-dependencies
./build/configure-builds
cd ./build/Release/
make
cd ../..

<optional> The sources contain a cuda implementation of part of this program. To use it you need to install cuda and make sure the macro USE_CUDA is defined before compiling.

RUN:
./build/Release/src/wawa <options>
Options:
     -l, -load <file>: load configuration file
     -e, -export <name>: export amplitude grid for each frequencies in the file <name>.obj
     -i, -import <name>: import amplitude grid for each frequencies in the file <name>.obj
     -stop <t>: stop animation and exit at time t
     -em <name>: export heightfields and render files in a set of files <name><frame number>.ong and <name><frame number>.xml
     -es, -export_step <n>: export every n frames
     -h, -help: print help				


OPTION:
You can use the macro defined in src/setting.hpp to switch between interactive or static waves (INTERACTIVE_), using or not the Cuda implementation (USE_CUDA), and using a projective grid or a fix one (PROJECTED_GRID).
The number of threads used by the program is defined in the same file (src/setting.hpp) by the macro
NTHREADS_.
